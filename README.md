# Handwriting Identification Experiment
### Introduction:
This project is simply an experiment to see if I can make a program that can Identify someone based on their handwriting. I started by asking some people I know to fill out a "survey". This only consisted of the survey takers writing the alphabet in capital letters four times each. You can find the "survey" in this repository. After every participant filled out the surveys, I scanned the document seperated the response tables into python-readable images.

### Technologies:
* Jupyter Notebook
